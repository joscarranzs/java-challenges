## Problematic  
In today's digital world, strong and secure passwords are essential for protecting personal and sensitive information. The challenge is to create a flexible password generator that allows users to define the length of the password and decide whether to include special characters. The program must be user-friendly and capable of generating random passwords efficiently.

---

## Proposal  

### Class  
- **Password**: A class that provides functionality to generate random passwords with customizable length and optional inclusion of special characters.

### Variables  
- `CHARS`: A `String` containing alphanumeric characters for password generation without special characters.
- `CHARS_WITH_SPECIAL`: A `String` containing alphanumeric and special characters for more secure passwords.
- `length`: An `int` that stores the default or user-defined password length.

### Methods  
- **`generate(int length, boolean withSpecial)`**: Generates a random password based on the specified length and whether special characters are included.  
- **`run()`**: Provides an interactive console-based interface for users to specify password preferences and generate passwords.

## Suggestions  

### Suggestion 1: Input Validation  
- Ensure that the user inputs a valid password length greater than 0.
- Handle invalid or unexpected input gracefully, such as non-integer values for length.

### Suggestion 2: Include Special Characters  
- Prompt the user for a choice to include special characters.
- Use the `CHARS_WITH_SPECIAL` string if the user opts for special characters, otherwise use `CHARS`.

### Suggestion 3: Random Password Generation  
- Utilize the `Random` class to generate random indices for character selection.
- Append the characters to a `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation.

### Suggestion 4: Interactive Console Interface  
- Provide clear and concise prompts for user input.
- Display the generated password directly after user preferences are entered.

## Results  

### Example 1: Password with Special Characters  
```
Welcome to Password Generator!  
Length: 12  
Include special characters (y/n): y  
Your password is: G!3n@2k&X!7P  
```

### Example 2: Password without Special Characters  
```
Welcome to Password Generator!  
Length: 8  
Include special characters (y/n): n  
Your password is: AbcD1234  
```

### Example 3: Invalid Input  
```
Welcome to Password Generator!  
Length: -1  
Length must be greater than 0.  
```

## Expected Outcome  
The program will generate secure and random passwords based on user input. The user can choose:  
- The length of the password.  
- Whether to include special characters for added security.  

If invalid input is provided, the program will prompt the user again until valid input is entered.

## Notes  
This password generator is designed for educational purposes and is a simple yet effective tool for learning Java concepts like randomization, input handling, and string manipulation. Feel free to adapt or expand the program to include additional features like saving passwords to a file.
